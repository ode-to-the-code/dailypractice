## Aside - Using Git

The three parts of your local repo are: local storage, staging area, commit history.
local storage -> staging area -> commit history ----->>>> remote repo

1. local storage -> staging area
```git add . # adds files to your staging area```

2. staging area -> commit history
```git commit -m # creating a commit```

TIP: use ```git commit -am``` to combine adding and commiting in one simple command. 

3. commit history local -> remote repo
git push // this pushes to the remote repo
