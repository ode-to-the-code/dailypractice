## USING GIT 

The three parts of your local repo are: local storage, staging area, commit history.
local storage -> staging area -> commit history ----->>>> remote repo

1. local storage -> staging area
```git add . # adds files to your staging area```

2. staging area -> commit history
```git commit -m # creating a commit```

TIP: use ```git commit -am``` to combine adding and commiting in one simple command. 

3. commit history local -> remote repo
git push // this pushes to the remote repo





## SELF-QUIZ QUESTIONS

1. What's one way to delete an element from an array?

2. How can you make a code snippet in markdown?

3. the important part is practice and breaking down the problem 


## PROBLEMS LOG 
# a list of the problems I do, with a summary of their purpose and an explanation/walkthrough of how they work. 

# Age To Days 
This one accepts an integer, which represents a person's age in years, and returns the number of days that adds up to. 

Since there are 365 days in a year, it multiplies that number by the number given as an argument. I interpolate that expression within a string that says 'I'm (however many) days old!'

# Anagram Or Not 
This function takes two strings, and decides if one is a permutation of the other. Like 'cat' and 'act'. 

It uses a dictionary
